We use [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uiw/doc) to manage the version of the `uiw` documentation site. Use the [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/@uiw/doc/web/index.html) preview. The [`uiw@2.0.0-beta.7+`](https://unpkg.com/@uiw/doc/web/index.html) version can be previewed.

> Old documentation preview: [v1.x.x](https://unpkg.com/uiw@1.16.14/dist/index.html)

This is the [v2.0.0+](https://unpkg.com/@uiw/doc@2.0.1/web/index.html) version preview example:

```
https://unpkg.com/@uiw/doc@<包版本>/web/index.html
# E.g:
https://unpkg.com/@uiw/doc@2.0.0-beta.12/web/index.html
```

This is a preview of the [v1.16.14](https://unpkg.com/uiw@1.16.14/dist/index.html) version, currently only this version of [`v1`](https://unpkg.com/uiw@1.16.14/dist/index.html) can be previewed

```bash
https://unpkg.com/uiw@1.16.14/dist/index.html
```

⚠️ The static resources of the documentation website were originally placed in the uiw package. Due to the large size of each installation of uiw, the download is very slow. From the [uiw@2.0.0-beta.7+](https://unpkg.com/@uiw/doc/web/index.html) version, it was extracted to a separate @uiw/doc package for Simultaneous release, all subsequent versions have documents to preview.
